## Research objective  
### Impact of the state of menstrual cycle on biopsy derived endometrial organoids (WIP)

Using single-cell data from endometerial organoids from [Fitzgerald et.al](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/46/23132#sec-8) 
and data from the [ "Single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human endometrium"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1040-z)
we are investigating whether there are detectable differences in gene expression, cell type mixture and ability to 
react to hormone treatment in organoids from different donors at different states of the menstrual cycle that can be related 
to the difference because of the cycle.
