## Research objective  
### Impact of the state of menstrual cycle on biopsy derived endometrial organoids 

Using single-cell data from endometerial organoids we are investigating whether there are detectable differences in gene expression, cell type mixture and ability to 
react to hormone treatment in organoids from different donors at different states of the menstrual cycle that can be related 
to the difference because of the cycle.

### Abstract

The endometrial epithelium is a highly dynamic tissue which plays an important role in human reproduction. Its dynamic nature and lack of accurate model systems make the understanding of molecular and morphological events and further research difficult. Organoids derived from biopsies offer new ways to gain insight into the dynamics and functioning of this tissue, but are themselves still a new method of modelling human organs. Within the frames of this project we want to assess whether the menstrual cycle stage of donors is mapped in organoids derived from endometrial biopsies or whether their development depends solely on external factors. We found that cell type development of endometrial organoids resembles that of *in vivo* tissue when comparing proliferative and secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. Further, gene expression patterns identified in endometrial tissue are detected in organoids but do not allow confident assignment of menstrual cycle phases. Ultimately, more data regarding endometrial organoids grown from biospies at different stages of the menstrual cycle is needed to create a better understanding of donor state influence on endometrial organoid development.
