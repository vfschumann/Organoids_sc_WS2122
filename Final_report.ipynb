    "The endometrial epithelium is a highly dynamic tissue which makes its research difficult. This is why, even though a lot of women all over the world struggle with diseases connected to the endometrial epithelium, very little research has been done so far. Organoids offer new ways to gain insight into the dynamics and functioning of this tissue, but are themselves still a new method of modelling human organs. The goal of this report is to assess whether the menstrual cycle stage of donors is mapped in organoids derived from endometrial biopsies or if their development depends solely on external factors during breeding.\n",
