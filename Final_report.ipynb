    "\n",
    "The endometrial epithelium is a highly dynamic tissue which plays an important role in human reproduction. Its dynamic nature and lack of accurate model systems make the understanding of molecular and morphological events and further research difficult. Organoids derived from biopsies offer new ways to gain insight into the dynamics and functioning of this tissue, but are themselves still a new method of modelling human organs. Within the frames of this project we want to assess whether the menstrual cycle stage of donors is mapped in organoids derived from endometrial biopsies or whether their development depends solely on external factors. We found that cell type development of endometrial organoids resembles that of in vivo tissue when comparing proliferative and secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. Further, gene expression patterns identified in endometrial tissue are detected in organoids but do not allow confident assignment of menstrual cycle phases. Ultimately, more data regarding endometrial organoids grown from biospies at different stages of the menstrual cycle are needed to create a better understanding of donor state influence on endometrial organoid development."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information about menstrual cycle and endometrium\n",
    "\n",
    "Each month the human endometrium undergoes a cycle of remodelling, shedding and regeneration. Comparable menstrual cycles are rarely found in other species which creates obstacles for modelling this sequence of events in established model organisms like mouse or zebrafish. (Hibaoui et al., 2020) Thus, even though the endometrium plays a crucial role in human reproduction, only little is known regarding the molecular and cellular events responsible for the dynamic changes throughout the menstrual cycle. Our aim with this project is to asses whether newly developed endometrial organoids derived from human endometrial biopsies resemble the menstrual cycle stage of their donor with a focus on gene expression in endometrial epithelium.\n",
    "\n",
    "The uterus is consists of two layers: an outer layer of smooth muscle (myometrium) and an internal layer called the endometrium. The latter is further divided into two functional layers. The outer functionalis layer is composed of dense glandular tissue surrounded by a loose connective stroma. This tissue is thickened and sloighed in response to ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle. The inner basalis layer is closest to the myometrium and contains primarily the base of the glands, dense stroma and large vessels. This layer serves as a germinal compartment for generating the new functionalis each month. (Figueira et al., 2011) Multiple cell types can be found. The endometrium consists mainly of lumenal and glandular epithelia, which are composed of ciliated and secretory cells. Covering the surface of the endometrium, the lumenal epithelium is the site of embryo attachment. The branched columnar glands open into the lumen and produce secretions that are rich in growth factors and lipids essential for placenta growth. (Garcia-Alsonso et al., 2021) The epithelial cells are supported by fibroblasts, immune cells, vascular and lymphatic systems. (Fitzgerald et al., 2019)\n",
    "\n",
    "The human menstrual cycle can be split into three phases during which the endometrium undergoes morphological and functional changes: menstrual phase, proliferative phase and secretory phase. Each cycle starts with the shedding of the functional upper layer, the stratum functionalis. Rising levels of estrogen then induce subsequent tissue repair and proliferation. The endometrial lining thickens. After ovulation, progesterone levels rise and induce the secretory phase during which decidualization takes place. At this point in time the endometrium is structurally and biochemically ideal for the implantation of an embryo. After implantation, the endometrium is the site of pregnancy. However, in the case that no embryo was implanted, estrogen and progesterone levels decrease eventually leading to the shedding of the functionalis layer and the cycle starts anew. (Critchley et al., 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the lack of accurate models, endometrial epithelial organoids (EEO) have been developed recently. Organoids are three-dimensional structures derived from endometrial tissues or menstrual flow samples that maintain morphology, function and gene signature of the endometrium. Garcia-Alonso et al. have already found that ahead of hormonal treatment, the majority of organoids are proliferative and express estrogen receptors. The differentiation of organoid cells into ciliated and secretory cells and advancement of the menstrual cycle can be induced by ovarian hormones. However, it is still to be evaluated whether they resemble the endometrial epithelium closely enough in order to use them for in vitro research in context with diseases and fertility issues. (Garcia-Alonso et al., 2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "As EEO are still quite new, there are a lot of open questions regarding their potential of modelling the human endometrium. In order to address them, we investigated cell type specific and regulatory genes that are involved in the menstrual cycle both in human tissue and in organoids.The endometrium is a highly dynamic tissue with its gene expression driven by steroid hormones. Thus, endometrial organoids can be exptected to follow a similarly dynamic behavior upon hormonal treatment. By identifying a set of important genes in endometrial tissue samples as well as represented cell types, we compared patterns between tissue and corresponding organoids before and after hormonal treatment."

    "During the menstrual cylce the endometrium undergoes constant changes. Hereby multiple significant changes were identified and are used to classify the menstrual cycle in its flow, proliferating and secretory phase respectively. Among those characteristic changes are the dynamic in cell type composition and in expression of certain phase specific marker genes. In the following we present our results and steps that we took in order to investigate those in regards of endometrial tissue samples and organoids derived from endometrial biopsies. \n",

    "\n",
    "For the analysed tissue samples expression of marker genes representing their corresponding phase of the menstrual cycle, either proliferative phase or secretory phase, was detected. The markers used for determination of the menstrual cycle phases in our samples have been collected from multiple sources, though Garcia-Alonso et al. and Wang et al. have to be emphasized as the main source.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, organoid samples without any hormone treatment did not show similar gene expression patterns as observed in the tissue samples of comparable menstrual cycle phase. As the menstrual phases are controlled by levels of steroid hormone levels, their absence in organoid tissue could lead to a decline in already established gene expression of their origin cells as the endometrial organoids mature. During the proliferative phase, estrogen levels begin to rise leading to the thickening of the endometrial lining through proliferation of stroma, glands and elongation of spiral arteries. The secretory phase begins after ovulation, when progesterone levels begin to rise and functionality is shifted towards secretion of glycogen and mucus. In the absence of pregnancy both estrogen and progesterone levels drop resulting in the shedding of the functionalis layer which corresponds to the menstrual phase.\n",
    "However, we were able to identify some marker genes of the proliferative phase in the organoids which is in agreement with the anaylsis of Garcia-Alonso et al. who found that before hormone treatment a majority of endometrial organoids are proliferative. This suggests that establishment of endometrial organoids reprograms the cells to restart the menstrual cycle independent of their original phase. In order to test this hypothesis further, one would need to compare the gene expression of multiple endometrial organoids taken from different donors at different time points of the menstrual cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a means of comparison between menstrual cycle phases in tissue and organoids we then looked at gene expression in endometrial organoids stimulated with steroid hormones (estrogen and progesterone) simulating the in vivo process. Regarding marker genes for specific cycle phases, we mainly found proliferative phase markers in estrogen-treated as well as estrogen- and progesterone-treated organoids with an exception being secretory phase marker PAEP in the latter. As for the former, this result complies with the known course of the menstrual cycle as rising estrogen levels stimulate the beginning of the proliferative phase. In estrogen- and progesterone-treated organoids though, we expected further progress into early secretory phase which is driven by a rise in progesterone levels. A lack in the expected progress could however be a consequence of insufficient duration of incubation and growth after exposure to the steroid hormones. Contrary to our results, Garcia-Alonso et al. have found that organoids respond similarly to hormonal treatment as in vivo, based on label transfer through a logistic classifier. This is demonstrated by over a quarter of secretory cells in their analysis corresponding to glandular epithelium. After reviewing our data, we were not able to find markers genes used by them (SCGB2A2) nor could we detect an increase in glandular cells in organoids after hormonal treatment. In an effort to investigate this dynamic in the future, one could analyse the identified secretory cells in the organoid samples in further detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, throughout our analysis of endometrial tissue and organoid data, we were able to demonstrate various properties and dynamics of the menstrual cycle in a similar manner as shown in our source paper, Garcia-Alonso et al.. Our results partly support the hypothesis that external hormonal factors influence the development endometrial organoids. Nonetheless, in order to define distinct connections between menstrual phases of endometrial donor and organoid, more data of endometrial organoids need to be gathered especially concerning the establishment of endometrial organoids from different donors at different stages of the menstrual cycle. We hope that further research will allow deeper exploration of the female reproductive system and enable great progress in understanding the human body just a little bit better."
